        <p>Hello, my name is James Jernigan. Feel free to call me Jay or Jaybird. I began my journey into web development with the Georgia Tech
            Full Stack Web Development coding boot camp. This is an exciting and worthwhile experience that has changed me for the better.
            I have a background in sales and front-facing customer service. The boot camp just adds another facet to my  skill set. </p>
        <br>
        <p>At my last job I had extensive experience using a CRM. It made everything so much easier!
            I don't know how any sales job can do without it. I reminds you about tasks, calls, emails. It's great! You will never
            lose a customer because you forgot to call them back again.</p>
